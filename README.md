👋 Hi, I'm Pavan Pandya! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington, expected to graduate in May 2025. Currently, I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities as a Software Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer starting in June 2025.

## About Me
I’m someone who believes in the power of teamwork and genuine connections. I value building trust through ownership, reliability, and open collaboration. People who know me would describe me as curious, persistent, and always eager to learn and grow. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t shy away from challenges, whether they’re big or small. I take pride in working alongside others to tackle complex problems, always with the mindset that we can achieve so much more when we work together. In my free time, I love experimenting in the kitchen or taking long walks to unwind and gather fresh ideas. At the end of the day, I believe that success is about the journey and the people you share it with.
